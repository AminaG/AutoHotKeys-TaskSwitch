For example:

Win+C - go to the last command line window
Win+SHIFT+C Open new command line
Win+W - Go to microsoft word
Win+Shift+W - open new microsoft word windows
Hold(WIN)+W+W+W - move between microsoft word windows.
I want to set a shourtcut for each button.

I know I can move using WIN[1..9] the problem is that when pressing for example WIN+2 it moves to the first opened window, but I want to go back to the last opened window I used.

Thank you.

*Answer:
So I decide to do it by Myself by using Auto-HotKeys.
The is the APK file.
It's working in the example for Chrome, Notepad and sublime.

If you have an idea how to improve it,please contribute to the source code.
I need help with make it work for any software by configuration file (instead of change the APK for each software)
